# x86-codegen
##### *Work in progress, nowhere close to completion*
An experimental x86 code generator written in Rust. Consists of a dynamic assembler and an IR stage.

### Current progress
* Dynamic assembler with encoder generator for most instruction fields in x86_64 (REX, ModRM, VEX2, VEX3, immediate bytes).
* IR expression evaluater (very new)
